so far we have based most of our work on top of Lares, but now that we have our tools defined and working, what we really want is a python coding agent that emulates the capabilities of letta-code but we want the agent we create to retain the kv_cache_friendly=True configuration. So what I want you to do is to look at LETTACODE_KARLA_COMPARISON.md and try to come up with a plan to make karla as much like letta-code as possible in terms of the CLI and the system prompts and all of that. Cool? Output <promise>PLANNED</promise> when you have not only cloned most of the capabilities of letta-code but also verified they work through e2e testing you do yourself as an agent actually using karla through cli to solve problems anyway make a plan for all of that and put in ./karla/PLAN.md.
