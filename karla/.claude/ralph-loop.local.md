I want you to look in ./karla/PLAN.md AGAIN and take bite sized chunks of it that you can ACTUALLY validate and test in a single turn if possible and I want you to use your TodoWrite tool to create a plan for this piece of the larger PLAN.md and update it as you go along. Do not reward hack. you are looking for instances where you previously did reward hacking or missed it in a previous validation step. DO NOT confuse being done with one of the subtasks with completion with the overall task, which is to implement ./karla/PLAN.md to the actual specs listed there. This should take several turns. Output <promise>FULL_PLAN_IMPLEMENTED</promise> when the full plan is actually implemented and all have been sniff tested, validated and the actual tests actually pass.
